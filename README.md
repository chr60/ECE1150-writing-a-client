# ECE1150_lab1: writing a client

This introduces the Berkeley socket layer. You will write a client to interact
with the Weather Underground api. This is not trivial so donâ€™t wait until the
last minute! You have been warned.

The Weather Underground (wunderground.com) is a provider of weather
monitoring services including home stations. Your assignment is to write a
client that is able to receive and print the current weather conditions.
